# Multi-Campaign Inbox Feature - Implementation Progress

## Overview
This document tracks the progress of implementing the multi-campaign inbox feature according to the 4-phase development plan.

## ‚úÖ Phase 1: Data Structure & Storage Updates

### ‚úÖ Task 1.1: Update localStorage logic to store multiple campaigns as an array
**Status: COMPLETED** ‚úÖ

#### What was changed:
1. **Updated data structure in `app/inbox/page.tsx`**:
   - Modified `CampaignData` interface to include `id` and optional `name` fields
   - Added `saveCampaigns()` and `loadCampaigns()` helper functions
   - Implemented automatic migration from old single-campaign format (`'campaignData'`) to new array format (`'campaigns'`)
   - Updated state management from single `campaignData` to `campaigns` array with `selectedCampaignId`

2. **Updated save logic in `components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx`**:
   - Modified campaign launch flow to generate unique campaign IDs
   - Changed from overwriting single campaign to appending to campaigns array
   - Added error handling for localStorage operations
   - Maintained backward compatibility with legacy data

3. **Enhanced user experience**:
   - Added proper loading states for different scenarios (no campaigns, campaign not found)
   - Preserved existing demo functionality (persona assignments)
   - Improved error handling and logging

#### Technical Details:
- **Unique ID Generation**: Uses timestamp + random string format: `campaign-${Date.now()}-${randomString}`
- **Migration Strategy**: Automatically converts legacy `'campaignData'` to new `'campaigns'` array format
- **Data Structure**: 
  ```typescript
  interface CampaignData {
    id: string;
    agent: Agent;
    qualifiedCompanies: QualifiedCompanyWithResearch[];
    selectedPersonas: SelectedPersona[];
    createdAt: string;
    name?: string; // Auto-generated from agent title
  }
  ```

#### Files Modified:
- `app/inbox/page.tsx` - Updated data loading and state management
- `components/chat/ChatInterface.tsx` - Updated save logic and interface definitions
